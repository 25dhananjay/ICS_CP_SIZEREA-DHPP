#PROJECT NAME-AREA CALCULATOR
This is a simple C program that calculates the area of various geometric shapes based on user input. The user can choose from a menu of shapes, input the required parameters, and the program will calculate and display the corresponding area.
#How to Use 
Follow these step-by-step instructions to execute the code:
#Prerequisites
Make sure you have a C compiler installed on your system.
If not, you can download and install one or you can also use online compiller
 
#Using the Program
1.	Upon running, the program will display a menu of shapes.
2.	Enter the number corresponding to the shape for which you want to calculate the area.
3.	Follow the prompts to input the required parameters (e.g., side lengths, radius, etc.).
4.	The program will then calculate and display the area of the selected shape.
5.	Repeat the process as needed or exit the program.
#Example
Choose a desired shape to calculate its area : 
1. Square
 2. Rectangle
 3. Triangle 
4. Circle 
5. Ellipse
 6. Parallelogram 
7. Trapezoid
 8. Rhombus
 9. Regular Pentagon 
10. Regular Hexagon
 11. Equilateral Triangle
 12. Isosceles Triangle
 Enter the number corresponding to the shape area to be calculated: 2 Enter the length of the rectangle: 5
 Enter the width of the rectangle: 8 
The area of the selected shape is: 40.000000
